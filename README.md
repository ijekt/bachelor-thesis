# bachelor-thesis
This repository contains the python and matlab scripts of the implemented code for the analysis of my bachelor thesis "Exploring effective preprocessing methods of MEG and EEG data for a cognitive fatigue study: A comparative analysis"

short description of content:

Python scripts are jupyter notebooks and can be messy at some point, due to jumping back into several single parts and for specific plots while writing the text of the thesis. Matlab script are live scripts for implementing DSS model

python script labeled with "QC_..." contain:
- full model setup
- followed by quality control steps

python scripts labeled with "AC_..." contain:
- model setup only for better and faster overview after running model multiple times
